     <P>"I am more talented than I believe!!". The prospect of exploring and learning new things energises me. My Name is Vivek Kumar and Currently, I am pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science from the well-known "I .K . Gujral Punjab Technical University, Main Campus ". One of the happiest professions has been identified as engineering!! Since I started attending engineering college, my journey has changed significantly for the better. I think it's extremely important to combine one's interests with their academic pursuits, thus I'm pursuing my passion for Developing . I like to write code for other websites in my spare time. Writing allows me to express my thoughts and emotions in a clear and concise manner, and it also keeps my mind active. I am currently working as a Android developer Team  in Google Developer Student Club of IKGPTU,  Student Coordinator at Technical Club at IKGPTU . I'm always looking for ways to improve and I'm confident that I can make a positive impact in any position I take on.

        <p>And when it comes to developing UI and UX, words are often specific UI/UX terms. You need a glossary on the blog so you can refer to it, reading an article about the elements of user interface. It makes sense to shed light on the most commonly used UX terminology at design conferences and meetups.</p>
